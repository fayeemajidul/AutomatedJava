Difference between waits:

There are four waits in selenium, need to render elements on to the page.

-- Implicit Waits:
    -- Tell the program p step to wait until  program loads for n seconds.
        -- Each step has unique n seconds.
        -- Apply globally.

-- Explicit Waits:
    -- unlike implicit, explicit is able to target a specific element to load a specific number of seconds.
    -- applies locally.

-- Thread Sleep Waits:
    -- part of java, telling java to wait for n seconds. Does not listen to the DOM.

-- Fluent Waits:

each do different things.

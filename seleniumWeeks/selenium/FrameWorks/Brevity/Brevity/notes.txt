What we mainly went over yesterday:

-- Yesterday we went over two classes in Java
1) Extent Reports

2) Screenshot:


_--------_

Screen Shot + Extent report when test fails.

Listeners are placed into the TESTNG.xml

at start: configure extent report

When test fails: take a screen shot

when finished: flush the extent report class


--------

When writing two tests in //, they will overwrite before methods, so you have to do a method to safely tell testng not over write one method.

use ThreadLocal, it protects each methods to not overwrite any methods. thread safe

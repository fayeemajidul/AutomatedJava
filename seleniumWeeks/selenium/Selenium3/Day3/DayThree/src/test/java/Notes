Advantages of TestNG:
-- Frame Work: Really convenient
-- Annotations, parameters, etc.

-- To separate Tests, do the test annotation you can group tests together with TestNG

----------------------------------------

Some syntax of methods and method name will start with a specific mobile,api or anything. In order to exclude that from our tests we can write a method

Method: Exclude method and you put "Mobile .*" --> this will exclude any method from being tested that begins with Mobile.



Different TestNG annotations:
 - BeforeMethod
 - Before Test the entire test?e 
 - Before Suite
 - Before Class

 - AfterMethod -- After every test this test will be called
 - After Test
 - After Suite
 - After Class

--- Heirachy:
XML, TEST, CLASS, METHOD

--> TestNG Methods:
    TestNG executes based on alphabetical order,
    in order to go around that you can say DependsOn method and proceed.
    You can skip methods using, (enabled = false)

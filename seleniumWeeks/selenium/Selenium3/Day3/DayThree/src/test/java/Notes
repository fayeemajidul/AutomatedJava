Advantages of TestNG:
-- Frame Work: Really convenient
-- Annotations, parameters, etc.

-- To separate Tests, do the test annotation you can group tests together with TestNG

----------------------------------------

Some syntax of methods and method name will start with a specific mobile,api or anything. In order to exclude that from our tests we can write a method

Method: Exclude method and you put "Mobile .*" --> this will exclude any method from being tested that begins with Mobile.

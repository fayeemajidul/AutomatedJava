Parameterization:

* In the instance we want global variables to be used in XML file,
we can create parameters.

Specific Test Level/ Method Level annotations:
--> Parameterizing with multiple data sets
    --> Data Provider annotation:
    @DataProvider



So What Have we learned:

The Heirachy of TESTNG
    --> SUITE, TEST, CLASS, METHOD
    --> BeforeMethod AfterMethod, Include, Exclude, REGEX include with regex
    --> Prioritizing Test Cases
    --> Parameterizing
    --> DataProvider Annotation
    --> Regression test: running mulitple test at once and smoke test to signal out.
    --> Learned Grouping as well.

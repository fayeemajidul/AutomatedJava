Today is December 6TH:

--> Demand for a Mobile Test Engineer is prevalent:

-- we will need to hold ourselves accountable every single day to not waste a single minute mainly because we have interviews to prepare for with the addition of a very haste deadline.
-- We need to provide and remember our values and why we had started this in the first place. This is mainly temporary, but you have to try your hardest.


Future course work to have a better edge in the market:
---> Cypress
---> JavaScript, C#
---> SOAPui: API backend services.
---> Better hands on approach with SQL querying.


Remember to review everything that you learn so you integrate everything and not forget.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].

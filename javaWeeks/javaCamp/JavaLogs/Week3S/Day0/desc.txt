You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

 

Example 1:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

HashTable vs HashMaps: Blah blah same thing.

1 - London --> New York --> Destination.

    ---> Basically from the Array create a loop that goes through every city, and if it contains, the city we are looking for grab the Key retrieve the value, and check if there are any values after.
___________________

1 - Create a Loop of Cities.

2 -  Iterate through the Loop of Cities.

3 -  city.get(London) --> "New York"

4 - city.get (New York) --> "Lima"

5 - city.get (Lima) --> "Sao Paulo"

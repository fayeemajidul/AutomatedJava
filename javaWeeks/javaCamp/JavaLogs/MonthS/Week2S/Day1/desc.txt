Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

The idea of the target value is that it should be able to retrieve that index: 

1) So now that we have our sorted Array
    --> How do we search for target?

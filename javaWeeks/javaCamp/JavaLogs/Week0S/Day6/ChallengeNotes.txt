Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= strs.length <= 200
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
    strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.



["flower", "Flow", "flight"]

1 - get every element in the string
2 - now that you grabbed the element, grab every char in the string
3 - compare each word.char[i] with the word2.char[i]
4 - if one case equals add that char to string.
5 - then move onto the next element [i+1] for both words if they are the same add the word to the str
6 - if not then terminate and traverse through the rest of the chars.

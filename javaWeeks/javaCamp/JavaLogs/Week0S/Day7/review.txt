How can we properly and efficently apply what we have learned?

1 - I think what we should do is first start off with a leet code Challenge

2 - After we'll review concepts by tim, doing a challenge per section


Leet Code Challenge:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


Write a method named getEvenDigitSum with one parameter of type int called number. 

The method should return the sum of the even digits within the number. 

If the number is negative, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

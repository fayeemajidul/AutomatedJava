Writing this on Friday, July 8th.

I did not hold myself accountable the last time. This time I will be held accountable. [I will be taking off one nail per amount of times I'm not able to deliver to my systematic goals]

Week 0 is very serious please be consistent! The more you're consistent the more you'd be able to learn from Java and get into QA.


My goals for Week 0:

-> Finish Section 2:
	-> Organize my files, relearn Java.

-> Spend at least 10 hours a week on Java.

-> Create a project meaningful to you.

-> Have fun!

Entire Java Course Work will be finished in 6 Weeks.
---> We're on 2/6: Update on July 25th.

----- Days I have not tried my best ---
 ---> August 18, 2022. 
			--- I been having problems with my health. I really don't give a fuck, what am I going to do to hold myself accountable?
			--- There needs to be consequences for missing even a day. We will not fuck up no matter what
			--- If you want to be that good role model, remember to try your hardest. 
			--- If you want people leaving you then just quit everything.
			// TRY HARDER TOMORROW //

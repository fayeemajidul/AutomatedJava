\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Goals \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

-- Do not slack off, hold yourself accountable everyday. As long as you do mindful work do not worry about wasted time.
-- You have roughly one week to complete this course. You have to start applying now.
-- Do not get your hopes up, remember what hope can do to you. It is the most painful tragedy.
-- Look into yourself and how do you see yourself growing each day. Build your identity as 10020, and make it come true.
